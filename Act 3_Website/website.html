            <div class="intro">
                Way back when I was still in high school, I enjoyed playing online games. And I
                was too preoccupied with playing it at the time.I chose to save my allowance and
                ride my bike instead of taking public transportation from our house to school. I'm
                used to playing online games as soon as I get home. I'll hurry up and get dressed
                myself and then leave right away because sometimes when I go to the computer
                shop there is no vacant PC, so I will wait for maybe an hour to use it and to play it.

            <div class="body">
                Furthermore, I chose IT in senior high school because I had watched the
                kdrama Start-up, and Nam Do-San was my favorite and most inspirational
                character. He is extremely intelligent, but he suffers from a lack of confidence
                as well as guilt. He was such a sweet and gentle soul. He battled against the
                odds to succeed in his career. I see myself in his role. Therefore, I made the
                decision to take the IT course in college. However, my dream job is to become
                a software developer, and I believe that this path would bring me to the top. I
                was wondering if I could create an app that would help other people's lives
                easier and enhance my skills, knowledge, and productivity to become a good
                programmer and developer.

            <div class="end">Moreover, Iâ€™m eager to do my best and work hard to achieve success. I will
                increase my ambition and step forward to become a good software developer.
                I just want to leave a few lines. This also inspires me. "Life isn't a dream, you
                know. It was a good dream, and she seems to have slept well. It's time to wake
                her up. " This line comes from the character Mrs. Choi, in the Start-up series.
